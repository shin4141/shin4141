I independently examine and repair failure boundaries in AI agents and automated systems—including false completion, duplicate execution, broken retry/resume, state drift, and authority mismatch.

**OpenSSL — upstream adoption in `master`.** Recursive seed-source construction could exhaust the stack → the reviewed repair now fails cleanly; [PR #32685](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/32685) remains `Closed`, and adoption is recorded in [commit `aeeca5a`](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/aeeca5a9e07166183fe323f336c9177a9b524c78).

**32 direct upstream merges across 28 independent public repositories** — [NIST #775](https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/pull/775), [Microsoft #1254](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/pull/1254), and [Apple #939](https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator/pull/939).

**Release recognition:** Listed under “New Contributors” in the [NIST macOS Security Compliance Project’s mSCP 2.0 / Release 27.0 notes](https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/releases/tag/release_27.0), which also include my merged fix for excluded rules in the JSON manifest (#775).

## Technical boundary focus

I focus on consequential state transitions — places where a system says something is complete, settled, authorized, recorded, cancelled, or recovered, but the underlying state does not fully support that claim.

**I don’t just fix the broken point. I repair the transition so the system can move forward without carrying the same failure into its next state.**

Typical boundaries: retry, rollback, replay, partial progress, authority changes, durable state, payment / settlement state, and AI-agent handoff.

The scope is technical boundary audit and repair, not comprehensive security, compliance, or every-environment coverage.

## Public upstream acceptance

The two acceptance routes below are distinct: maintainer-committed upstream adoption and direct upstream PR merges.

### OpenSSL adoption beyond a direct PR merge

- **[OpenSSL #32685](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/32685) — RAND seed-source recursion.** Recursive construction could exhaust the stack → upstream committed the reviewed repair to `master` as [`aeeca5a`](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/aeeca5a9e07166183fe323f336c9177a9b524c78), with `Merged-from` pointing to #32685. The PR remains `Closed`; the [OpenSSL 4.1 cherry-pick](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b2d073565875664d8baee1493e9a07eca922687d) is the same repair and is not counted again.

### Direct upstream acceptance

Each link exposes the failure boundary, bounded repair, and third-party direct upstream acceptance:

- **[NIST / macOS Security Compliance Project #775](https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/pull/775).** Excluded rules could leak into the generated JSON manifest → preserve the exclusion policy in manifest generation; merged upstream and listed in the project’s release notes.
- **[Microsoft / terraform-provider-power-platform #1254](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform/pull/1254).** An HTTP 409 could be mistaken for success → re-read remote state and keep bounded retry when the requested state is absent; approved and merged.
- **[Apple / swift-openapi-generator #939](https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator/pull/939).** Generated Swift type-name collisions could crash recursive-type boxing → return a deterministic diagnostic; maintainer feedback was addressed and the patch was merged.
- **[Hyperledger Besu / Ethereum #11128](https://github.com/besu-eth/besu/pull/11128).** Human summary text could corrupt state-test JSONL → omit only that summary in ordinary JSON mode; approved and merged.
- **[Anza / Solana Kit #1971](https://github.com/anza-xyz/kit/pull/1971).** Single-field fixed-size codecs lost the literal `fixedSize` type → preserve it without changing multi-field behavior; review feedback was incorporated and the patch was merged.
- **[Sony / nmos-cpp #520](https://github.com/sony/nmos-cpp/pull/520).** Invalid interface IDs could make IS-04 resources schema-invalid → validate and use the existing safe fallback; review feedback was incorporated and the patch was merged.
- **[Vercel / workflow #3575](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3575).** A step could commit without its replay event → write both atomically while preserving orphan recovery; approved and merged.

### Upstream adoption beyond direct merges

- **[OpenClaw / Memory Core #129927](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/129927) — memory indexing / bounded batch recovery.** When an embedding provider explicitly rejected an oversized batch, Memory Core could stop instead of continuing safely with smaller batches. I submitted the [original fix in #125722](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/125722); upstream carried it forward into a replacement PR, explicitly credited me as `@shin4141`, and merged that replacement PR.
- **[NIST / FiPy #1225](https://github.com/usnistgov/fipy/pull/1225) — maintainer-implemented technical finding / lazy dependency boundary.** My original PR #1224 was closed under the project’s generative-AI content policy, but a focused countercase on the maintainer replacement PR exposed a remaining lazy-dependency break in `alpha_constraint`. A reviewer made addressing my comment a condition of approval; the maintainer refined the causal diagnosis, implemented the lazy expression and regression coverage, and merged the repair upstream.

### Full verified merge ledger

All 32 verified direct merges—including OSC / Open OnDemand #5725, Adyen #1760, Dynawo / DyCoV #385, and PowerGridModel #1547—are preserved in the canonical detailed ledger:

**[Open the full verified merge portfolio →](MERGE_PORTFOLIO.md)**

Boundary coverage: **STATE / TRANSITION ×7** · **DATA / CONTEXT ×6** · **CONFIG / POLICY ×7** · **RETRY / RECOVERY ×2** · **INSTALL / COMPLETION ×2** · **TRANSPORT / PARTIAL PROGRESS ×1** · **NUMERIC / REPRESENTATION ×7**

These are public OSS contributions, not client engagements or evidence of paid commercial conversion. A merged OSS contribution is not a commercial outcome or client endorsement.

## One bounded boundary first

You do not need to rely on me for every issue.
Start with one consequential boundary.
I aim to leave not only the repair, but also the conditions and checks that help your team or AI recognize the same class of failure next time.

If that proves useful, bring me back for the next consequential boundary.
